# Telegram Notify

Telegram Notify will be a service for the purpose of consuming events published from kafka (backend service), which will receive event types like (error, warning, etc...).
And finally will send a message to the telegram bot for the purpose of easily identifying when there is an error.

This is just a small service for illustration
